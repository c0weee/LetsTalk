The primary goal of this project is to create a discussion forum where users can interact with one another on topics that interest them. Users are primarily able to read the discussion forum without having to sign up for an account, but to be further engaged in, they would require one. The basic functionalities of the web application include the creation and updating of users, groups, threads and post.
